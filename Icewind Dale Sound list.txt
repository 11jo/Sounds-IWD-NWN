Customizing Icewind Dale Sound Personalities
============================================

The following is a list of the WAV files required to create custom sound
personality sets.  In the 'Sounds' folder located in the directory in which
Icewind Dale is installed in, you will need to create a subdirectory that is
used to store your new character personality.  The new folder can be up to 32
characters in length.  This folder will be displayed in the game as one
of the voice set options.  Below is a listing of all the required voice sounds
that are needed in that new subdirectory.  Replace the xxxxx with a unique name
that would not be used in other subdirectories.  For example, mysnd01,
mysnd02, etc.  As long as the xxxxx is unique, the voice sounds will show up
and work properly in Icewind Dale.

All of the sound files must be 22 kHz, 16-bit, mono WAV files.
